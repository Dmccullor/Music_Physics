<p style="font-size: 20px">Music is a fascinating phenomenon. Some say it was invented, other say it was discovered. The truth is a bit of both.
    Music is found in various forms all over the world, but what is it really? And why does it sound good to us?
    Let's take a look at some of the fundamentals.
    <br><br>
    When we hear sounds, we are hearing subtle changes in the pressure in the air around us. Musical notes are variations in the air pressure
    that oscillate at a regular frequency. Our brains are pattern finding machines, so when we hear this stable vibration it sounds pleasurable to us.
    The purest form of this vibration is called a <em>sine wave</em>. Take a look at the chart below to see what a graphical representation of a sine wave looks like.

<br><br>

<br><br>
<p style="font-size: 20px">The sine wave has two main properties: <em>pitch</em> and <em>amplitude</em>. The pitch is associated with the frequency of the oscillation.
    For instance, the frequency of middle A is 440 Hz, or the number of times the vibration occurs in 1 second. The amplitude is how loud the note sounds to us.
    When we double this frequency, we get 880 Hz. This is also A, but it is up one <em>octave</em>. The octave is the next instance of the note at the end of the <em>scale</em>.
    Here is the scale that begins on the note C:
</p>
<br><br>

<br><br>
<p style="font-size: 20px">The C scale is easy to understand because it is the only scale that has no notes that are augmented with sharps(#) or flats(b).
    We won't worry about that here. Instead let's focus on the <em>interval</em> between the notes in the scale. An interval refers to the space between two notes.
    The octave is the interval between middle A and high A (or between middle C and high C) and is the interval with the most <em>consonance</em>.
    The opposite of consonance is dissonance, which is basically a disharmony between the notes. Consonance and dissonance are not binary and the interplay between
    them is what makes music interesting!
<br><br>
    So, now we know that the frequency for middle A is 440 Hz and its higher octave is 880 Hz. Halfway between the two is 660 Hz, which is the (perfect)5th note
    in the scale. In this case, the 5th note would be E. This is next most consonant interval. Keep in mind that humans intuitively knew this before these frequencies
    were ever measured. The arrangement and systems of notes were developed purely by how they sounded.
<br><br>
    The next most consonant interval in the A scale is C# with a freqency of 550 Hz. C#, in relation to A, is the (major)3rd. All of these notes played together
    is called a major <em>chord</em>. The major chord of any note has the same intervals between the notes. The A major chord is A C# E A. The C major chord is C E G C.
    Play around with the chart below to see how all of the notes look when mapped as a sine wave. Notice that the octave, which is shown by default, takes half the time
    to make its oscillation (also known as the <em>period</em>) as the root note. Tick the checkboxes below the chart to add the 5th and 3rd sinewaves.

    <b>Note: The frequency on the x-axis and amplitude on the y-axis are independent of one another, but have been adjusted for visual clarity.</b>
